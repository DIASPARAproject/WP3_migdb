# WP3 DIADROMOUS FISH DATABASE
Design an international database for model parameters and life history parameters  (deliverable D3.4)

Large amounts of biological and model data are collected but are not centrally stored or structured for all species. This task involves the creation of a database structure that can accommodate various biological parameters and model data for different species, improving efficiency and accessibility, and moving towards a TAF.
Subtasks
1. Ensure link with RDBES/ICES/GFCM, use database format developed for eel to store biological parameters.
2. Identify the needs of different working groups, reuse the database structures currently used in the WGEEL and WGNAS and extend it to the new model parameters and life history parameters.

In practise two databases have been created

The first holds life history traits and time series, mostly in continental habitats, at a series of electrofishing sites, or traps. It is called the **METRIC DB**.
The second is a database of stock parameters, variables, and data, collected at the scale of the assessment unit. It is called the **STOCK DB**
Both are integrated into the DIADROMOUS FISH DATABASE.
