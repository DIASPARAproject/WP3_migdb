# And why?

::::: columns
::: {.column .incremental width="50%"}
-   These species are found all over Europe
-   To conduct large-scale modeling, a significant amount of data is required
-   Such data must be easily accessible
:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%"}
-   FAIR data bases – Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability
-   Transparent Assessment Framework (TAF)

BACKGROUND
:::

# Similar needs in diadromous assessment groups

-   Different levels of advancement but common “deadlocks”
-   Some things will require lots of work
    -   If we start to work together now, it will be more efficient

# Current status of databases

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/clipboard-2701286006.png)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Available databases are for marine habitats and are designed for fisheries data (e.g., ICES RDBES)
-   Working groups have created their own databases:
    -   Stored in different database formats

    -   Different level of detail

    -   Sometimes large Excel files and/or external databases

    -   Within each group, individuals are dedicated to database work

2.  WHAT WE WILL BE DOING
:::

# Our Aim

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Develop **four database templates** to facilitate more advanced and transparent assessment of migratory fish species.
-   These databases will be tailored for freshwater stages, incorporating a hydrographic network and migration barrier data.
:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%"}
-   **Subtasks**
    -   Identify the needs of different working groups
    -   Discuss interoperability and storage with ICES and GFCM
    -   Propose a template suitable for different species
    -   Validate the structure by testing the integration of data provided by the project partners
:::
:::::

# Identifying WG needs, discuss with ICES & GFCM {.scrollable}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Several discussions with different organisations, people, groups
-   Presenting our main idea, identifying the needs of others
-   **What we propose in this workshop, we want to discuss with the WGs**
    -   Finding common ground and differences
    -   Continuing discussions at the WGs
:::

::: {.column .incremental width="50%"}
-   Databases should be designed to be interoperable, ***capable of handling nested spatial scales*** and able to address a variety of stressors.

-   Our goal is to deliver databases / referentials that can be effectively utilized by working groups (WGBAST, WGNAS, WGEEL, WGTRUTTA) in the long term.

# Creating the base, not (necessarily) the data {.scrollable}

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="25%"}
**Creating common dictionaries**

![](images/clipboard-3254899733.png)
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
-   Create separate tables for each working group
    -   Some common information for all WGs, some separate
-   Common "simple" layer for international assessment needed - open data
    -   All data does not (necessarily) have to be common or open
:::

::: {.column .incremental width="35%"}
-   Potential for updates in the future
    -   At some point there will be better international data available
-   Possibility to have better data for some areas / WGs
    -   National data will (always) be better
:::
::::::

## Producing common dictionaries together with ICES

::::: columns
::: {.column .incremental width="50%"}
-   Will be used for both:
    -   Raw data in RDBES for catch and landings
    -   Stock assessment database
-   Examples: age and lifestage
-   Referencials for habitat
-   Hierarchical so that spatial units can be integrated separately for different WGs

# And therefore, the Deliverables

A quick look - details will be discussed on Tuesday

# Design four (now five) international databases

::::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
![](images/clipboard-4041496170.png)
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
-   Electrofishing
-   Habitat
-   Migration obstacles
-   Model parameters
-   Life history strategies, biological data
-   **Templates will be created**
:::
:::::

## Electrofishing data

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-639830824.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Currently it is just different templates for data call
-   We plan produce something together with the WGs
    -   Ask all WGs what it should be - then propose a common structure
-   If it looks good, we will migrate to a common database
-   No need to have a separate EF database for different species(?)
:::
:::::

## Habitat and migration obstacles

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-1683463804.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Migration obstacles
-   Habitat availability, for models
-   Extend the work from e.g., AMBER and Sudoang
-   Use habitat work from Philip McGinnity and Andrew French
:::
:::::

## Model parameters, life history parameters

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Biological and model data that are not centrally stored
-   Moving towards Transparent Assessment Framework
-   Link with ICES working groups
-   Reuse WGEEL, WGNAS structures
-   New parameters in DIASPARA project

# Our feeling is that a common format can be found for salmon, trout and eel!

(without large compromises)

## Biological data, biometry

:::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
-   **GFCM - RDBFIS:**

    -   This information could be used in the RDBFIS database as well. Collaboration where possible.

-   **DCF data:**

    -   Potential for RDBES?

## RDBES proposal - priorities

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-15895673.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  Commercial landings
2.  Recreational landings
3.  Store data that we currently store in sampling that are related to DCF sampling (raw data)
4.  Once this is done, talk about storing electrofishing data
5.  SAM model parameters - start with postgres and see whether it fits somewhere in ICES
6.  DAM and hydro db - Maybe JRC?
7.  Scripts to produce data from the RDBES will be needed, it has to be TAF

Our work principles
:::

# Finally, a bit about our principles

## Everything is online

:::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
-   Progress can be followed throughout
-   Several releases: beta versions privately in Zenodo and then publicly as soon as the data are validated
-   Can be commented during the project
-   Postgis and parquet formats using R.

## DATSU

:::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
-   DATSU is not one of project deliverables, but
-   As common dictionaries are used, DATSU can streamline future data calls

![](images/clipboard-3451821426.png)
:::
::::

# Principles {.scrollable}

-   Dictionaries
    -   Follow ICES vocab, create when not existing (search for all vocab)
    -   Allow for the hierarchichal spatial scale to be integrated in queries. Separate the input of different WGs in different schema but the same db (postgres).
    -   Some common dictionaries - some separate dictionaries 
-   Model
    -   Separate parameters for model and aggregated data built at regional / national/ emu level
    -   Model parameters should be described in a separate metadata table (like WGNAS).
-   Keep changes minimal, don't add work to working group
-   Use ICES existing db whenever possible
-   Use DATSU to check for consistency / trace data. 
-   Raw data should go to RDBES (starting with landings), we'll need a timeline for WG work.

# Things to be agreed on

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-4040871849.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Electrofishing data

-   Get the needs from WGs and propose a common format, maybe within RDBES

-   SAM db common to all groups, stored somewhere in ICES

-   [Development of common dictionaries for things like Age, lifestages, all GIS geographical units]{style="color:#91b5c1;"}

-   Should all DCF data go to RDBES?

-   [GFCM - RDBFIS?]{style="color:#91b5c1;"}

-   More discussion tomorrow!
