## Habitat DB

The habitat DB also corresponds to some of the dictionaries created for the stock DB.

# Stock DB

This is the main database where we wish to put all unified data, details on the data
structure coming out but still need validation from ICES.

# Metrics DB

This database is part of the previous DB, using the same vocab, but the data
structure is different. There is already a mapping by ICES of the data structure.
The DB is currently in WGEEL (series + sampling) and we've release excel sheets
to call for LHT with WP2.
