# Stock DB

This is the main database where we wish to put all unified data, details on the data structure coming out but still need validation from ICES.

# Metrics DB

This database is part of the previous DB, using the same vocab, but the data structure is different. There is already a mapping by ICES of the data structure. The DB is currently in WGEEL (series + sampling) and we've release excel sheets to call for LHT with WP2.
