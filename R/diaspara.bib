  abstract = {This study provides new data on Atlantic salmon Salmo salar life-history traits across France. Using a long-term recreational angling database (1987--2013) covering 34 rivers in three regions (genetic units), a decline in individual length, mass and a delayed adult return to French rivers was reported. Temporal similarities in trait variations between regions may be attributed to common change in environmental conditions at sea. The relative rate of change in phenotypic traits was more pronounced in early maturing fish [1 sea-winter (1SW) fish] than in late maturing fish (2SW fish). Such contrasted response within populations highlights the need to account for the diversity in life histories when exploring mechanisms of phenotypic change in S. salar. Such detailed life-history data on returning S. salar have not previously been reported from France. This study on French populations also contributes to reducing the gap in knowledge by providing further empirical evidence of a global pattern in S. salar across its distribution range. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that the observed changes in life-history traits are primarily associated with environmental changes in the North Atlantic Ocean. They also emphasize the presence of less important, but still significant contrasts between region and life history.},

  abstract = {ICES, in consultation with the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO), convened a series of workshops to explore how to use biological and environmental data in models to advance the conservation of wild Atlantic salmon ({$<$}em{$>$}Salmo salar{$<$}/em{$>$} L.) at sea. This workshop set out to consider multiple candidate hypotheses contributing to changes in the temporal patterns of abundance, and agree the priority research questions.~ No agreement on the development of a set of priority marine mortality hypotheses was reached. This resulted from the recognition of the hierarchical nature of ecosystem controls, and important complexities introduced by evolutionary diversity. An integrated ecological-evolutionary framework was proposed for the evaluation of hypotheses, and to identify key points in space and time. There was an agreed need for the continuation of cooperative initiatives to examine drivers of marine growth change using standardised approaches, and in the evolutionary delineation of stock units. These were seen as productive pathways to significantly enhance understanding of the marine factors impacting species abundance. The workshop recognised that options for developing and testing hypotheses remain constrained by the availability and quality of data, and identified ways to mobilise existing knowledge resources on key aspects of salmon ocean ecology. These focused on the synthesis of physical ocean data and model outputs, involving ocean basin-wide evaluations of available energy from surveys of lower trophic levels, and updating of population-specific biological information. The workshop agreed on the need for a specific call for data from pelagic commercial fisheries, given the broad scale of this activity and potential overlap with salmon migrations. There was also the recognition that Atlantic salmon should be included in the ICES Working Group on Bycatch of Protected Species (WGBYC) Protected, Endangered and Threatened Species list. Much of the work required to mobilise useful data sources was recognised as being outside the scope of existing ICES data calls, or the constituted core work of ICES Working Group on North Atlantic Salmon (WGNAS). Recommendations for the third workshop are for 1. More detailed consideration of how to access the work needed for data mobilisation, and 2. The identification of well-defined, achievable outcomes.},

  abstract = {This study provides a regional picture of long-term changes in Atlantic salmon growth at the southern edge of their distribution, using a multi-population approach spanning 49 years and five populations. We provide empirical evidence of salmon life history being influenced by a combination of common signals in the marine environment and population-specific signals. We identified an abrupt decline in growth from 1976 and a more recent decline after 2005. As these declines have also been recorded in northern European populations, our study significantly expands a pattern of declining marine growth to include southern European populations, thereby revealing a large-scale synchrony in marine growth patterns for almost five decades. Growth increments during their sea sojourn were characterized by distinct temporal dynamics. At a coarse temporal resolution, growth during the first winter at sea seemed to gradually improve over the study period. However, the analysis of finer seasonal growth patterns revealed ecological bottlenecks of salmon life histories at sea in time and space. Our study reinforces existing evidence of an impact of early marine growth on maturation decision, with small-sized individuals at the end of the first summer at sea being more likely to delay maturation. However, each population was characterized by a specific probabilistic maturation reaction norm, and a local component of growth at sea in which some populations have better growth in some years might further amplify differences in maturation rate. Differences between populations were smaller than those between sexes, suggesting that the sex-specific growth threshold for maturation is a well-conserved evolutionary phenomenon in salmon. Finally, our results illustrate that although most of the gain in length occurs during the first summer at sea, the temporal variability in body length at return is buffered against the decrease in post-smolt growth conditions. The intricate combination of growth over successive seasons, and its interplay with the maturation decision, could be regulating body length by maintaining diversity in early growth trajectories, life histories, and the composition of salmon populations.},
