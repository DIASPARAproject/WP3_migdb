# WGNAS-ToolBox

The WGNAS ToolBox is a shiny application that supports and promotes the work done by the ICES Working Group on North Atlantic Salmon. The ToolBox consists of interactive
interfaces to work upstream and downstream the Life Cycle Model used for the stock assessment of Atlantic salmon. More specifically, the WGNAS ToolBox includes different tools:
- SalmoDataCollect, an interface whose access is restricted (ID and password) to WGNAS members and that allows to upload new or updated data to integrated in the Life Cycle Model
- SalmoDataVizu, a public interface to visualize the input data collected by the different members of the WGNAS and used for Atlantic salmon stock assessment, and the stock assessment outputs
- SalmoPred, a public interface to vizualize results of predictions for up to three years after stock assessment

This application was developed as part of the SalmoGlob project and the SAMARCH Intereg program. It was led by Etienne Rivot, Jérôme Guitton and Pierre-Yves Hernvann
from the Ecology and Ecosystems Health Research Unit, Agrocampus Ouest (Institut Agro) / INRAe (FR).
